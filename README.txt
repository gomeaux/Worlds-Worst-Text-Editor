I forgot to make a readme lol.

There isn't much to say about this. it sucks good luck using it.

This was made as a test to see what I could do. Pretty sure theres this
bug that makes the vector of strings do something stupid and it crashes
but I don't know what causes it or how to fix it. nor do i care.
Anyways use this at your own risk. this thing is windows only btw.
